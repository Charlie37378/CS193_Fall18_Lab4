Task 1:

// Under this line write a message to yourself from GitHub
Read Read Charlie.
// Under this line, describe what the command 'git fetch' does
After changes were made on the remote server of GitHub, if we want to know what changes were made on remote server, we use git fetch to get this information.

Task 2:

// Under this line describe why we need to run 'git push' after making a commit
Git commit is more like a save button in the game, after we commit a change the local system formally record the changes we made. Git push to let the remote server know what we committed, push all of the changes we made to the remote server and changes the file on remote server.

Task 3:

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-A'
Write something into branch-A, this is intimidating.

// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-B'
Hope this will work, this one will finally merge with the content I made in branch-A.
// Under this line, write a message to yourself from the branch 'branch-C'
This is from the new branch-C, a branch in branch-B.
// END OF LAB 4
